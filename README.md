# Lesson_02: CSS

Hello class this lesson will focus on Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). This is known as a style sheet language that most commonly used with HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). This allows a designer to customize the look and feel of a website.

HTML is divided into diffent tags \<div>\</div>, \<section>\</section>, \<span>\</span> etc etc, and a lot of these tags do not do anything in themselves, but let you target your CSS to. You can further target specific tags by adding "class" or "id" \<div class="hello">\</div>, \<span id="world">\</span>, \<section class="hello" id="world">\</section>.
